<h1 id="laptop">Laptop</h1>
<p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<p>The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer), refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user&#39;s lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. As of 2024, in American English, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably;[3] in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.[4] The term notebook originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.

<h3 id="ultrabook">Ultrabook</h3>
<p>Ultrabook is a term coined by computer chipmaker Intel for a special class of ultraportable notebook (hence Ultrabook). Ultrabooks must meet specific criteria for various things such as size/weight, battery life, type of chipset (including built-in security features).
Among their strong points is strong security and anti-theft protection built in at the hardware level.

<p>These combine the features of a laptop and a tablet. They&#39;re also known as 2-in-1 laptops or hybrids. 
They can quickly switch between touchscreen tablet mode and traditional keyboard mode, transforming in a variety of ways, including detaching, sliding, twisting and fold-back mechanisms. Most models now use the fold-back method, though a few still have detachable screens.

<p>The software is what makes the hardware work or lets you get things done, such as writing documents with Microsoft Word or playing a Solitaire game. Think of the hardware as being like your television set, and think of the software as being like the shows that you watch on it.
