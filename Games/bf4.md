# Battlefield 4

Dominate tactical challenges in a huge interactive environment — demolish buildings shielding your enemies, lead an assault from the back of a gun boat, or make a little C4 go a long way. In massive 64-player battles, use all your resources and play to your strengths to carve your own path to victory.


## Key features

### Dynamic battlefields

Interactive environments react to your actions in real-time, so you can trigger a shipwreck or flood the streets for a tactical advantage. Your opponents won't know what hit 'em.

### More vehicles, more freedom

Control the battlefield with dozens of vehicles, from helicopters and stealth jets to gunboats and anti-airs, all designed to give you an edge on massive, chaotic maps.

### An intense single-player campaign

With international tensions running high, you’ll need to evacuate critical American VIPs from Shanghai and battle against the odds to get your squad home.
